  abstract = {This work presents Information Theoretic HotStuff (IT-HS), a new optimally resilient protocol for solving Byzantine Agreement in partial synchrony with information theoretic security guarantees. In particular, IT-HS does not depend on any PKI or common setup assumptions and is resilient to computationally unbounded adversaries. IT-HS is based on the Primary-Backup view-based paradigm. In IT-HS, in each view, and in each view change, each party sends only a constant number of words to every other party. This yields an \$O(n\^2)\$ word and message complexity in each view. In addition, IT-HS requires just \$O(1)\$ persistent local storage and \$O(n)\$ transient local storage. Finally, like all Primary-Backup view-based protocols in partial synchrony, after the system becomes synchronous, all nonfaulty parties decide on a value in the first view a nonfaulty leader is chosen. Moreover, like PBFT and HotStuff, IT-HS is optimistically responsive: with a nonfaulty leader, parties decide as quickly as the network allows them to do so, without regard for the known upper bound on network delay. Our work improves in multiple dimensions upon the information theoretic version of PBFT presented by Miguel Castro, and can be seen as an information theoretic variant of the HotStuff paradigm.},

  abstract = {This report describes the Libra Byzantine Fault Tolerance (LibraBFT) algorithmic core and discusses next steps in its production. The consensus protocol is responsible for forming agreement on ordering and finalizing transactions among a configurable set of validators. LibraBFT maintains safety against network asynchrony and even if at any particular configuration epoch, a threshold of the participants are Byzantine. LibraBFT is based on HotStuff, a recent protocol that leverages several decades of scientific advances in Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) and achieves the strong scalability and security properties required by internet settings. Several novel features distinguish LibraBFT from HotStuff. LibraBFT incorporates a novel round synchronization mechanism that provides bounded commit latency under synchrony. It introduces a nil-block vote that allows proposals to commit despite having faulty leaders. It encapsulates the correct behavior by participants in a ``tcb''-able module, allowing it to run within a secure hardware enclave that reduces the attack surface on participants. LibraBFT can reconfigure itself, by embedding configuration-change commands in the sequence. A new configuration epoch may change everything from the validator set to the protocol itself.},

These cryptographicprotocols have practical and provably secure implementations in therandom oracle model.  In particular, a coin-tossing protocol based onthe Diffie-Hellman problem is presented and analyzed. The resulting asynchronous Byzantine agreement protocol is both practicaland theoretically optimal because it tolerates the maximum number ofcorrupted parties, runs in constant expected rounds, has message andcommunication complexity close to the optimum, and uses a trusted dealeronly once in a setup phase, after which it can process a virtually unlimitednumber of transactions. The protocol is formulated as a transaction processing service in acryptographic security model, which differs from the standardinformation-theoretic formalization and may be of independent interest.},

In a synchronous system, there is a known fixed upper bound {$\Delta$} on the time required for a message to be sent from one processor to another and a known fixed upper bound {$\Phi$} on the relative speeds of different processors. In an asynchronous system no fixed upper bounds {$\Delta$} and {$\Phi$} exist. In one version of partial synchrony, fixed bounds {$\Delta$} and {$\Phi$} exist, but they are not known a priori. The problem is to design protocols that work correctly in the partially synchronous system regardless of the actual values of the bounds {$\Delta$} and {$\Phi$}. In another version of partial synchrony, the bounds are known, but are only guaranteed to hold starting at some unknown time T, and protocols must be designed to work correctly regardless of when time T occurs. Fault-tolerant consensus protocols are given for various cases of partial synchrony and various fault models. Lower bounds that show in most cases that our protocols are optimal with respect to the number of faults tolerated are also given. Our consensus protocols for partially synchronous processors use new protocols for fault-tolerant ``distributed clocks'' that allow partially synchronous processors to reach some approximately common notion of time.},

Our experiments show how the different algorithmic ingredients of SBFT contribute to its performance and scalability. The results show that SBFT simultaneously provides almost 2x better throughput and about 1.5x better latency relative to a highly optimized system that implements the PBFT protocol. To achieve this performance improvement, SBFT uses a combination of four ingredients: using collectors and threshold signatures to reduce communication to linear, using an optimistic fast path, reducing client communication and utilizing redundant servers for the fast path. SBFT is the first system to implement a correct dual-mode view change protocol that allows to efficiently run either an optimistic fast path or a fallback slow path without incurring a view change to switch between modes.},

  abstract = {The concept of one event happening before another in a distributed system is examined, and is shown to define a partial ordering of the events. A distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing a system of logical clocks which can be used to totally order the events. The use of the total ordering is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization problems. The algorithm is then specialized for synchronizing physical clocks, and a bound is derived on how far out of synchrony the clocks can become.},

The lightweight approach of using OS-level virtualization features, including processes and network namespaces, allows it to scale to hundreds of nodes. Experiences with our initial implementation suggest that the ability to run, poke, and debug in real time represents a qualitative change in workflow. We share supporting case studies culled from over 100 users, at 18 institutions, who have developed Software-Defined Networks (SDN). Ultimately, we think the greatest value of Mininet will be supporting collaborative network research, by enabling self-contained SDN prototypes which anyone with a PC can download, run, evaluate, explore, tweak, and build upon.},

  abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

In this paper, we propose a practical new paradigm called Thunderella for achieving state machine replication by combining a fast, asynchronous path with a (slow) synchronous ``fall-back'' path (which only gets executed if something goes wrong); as a consequence, we get simple state machine replications that essentially are as robust as the best synchronous protocols, yet ``optimistically'' (if a super majority of the players are honest), the protocol ``instantly'' confirms transactions.},

  abstract = {The problem addressed here concerns a set of isolated processors, some unknown subset of which may be faulty, that communicate only by means of two-party messages. Each nonfaulty processor has a private value of information that must be communicated to each other nonfaulty processor. Nonfaulty processors always communicate honestly, whereas faulty processors may lie. The problem is to devise an algorithm in which processors communicate their own values and relay values received from others that allows each nonfaulty processor to infer a value for each other processor. The value inferred for a nonfaulty processor must be that processor's private value, and the value inferred for a faulty one must be consistent with the corresponding value inferred by each other nonfaulty processor.                            It is shown that the problem is solvable for, and only for,               n               {$\geq$} 3               m               + 1, where               m               is the number of faulty processors and               n               is the total number. It is also shown that if faulty processors can refuse to pass on information but cannot falsely relay information, the problem is solvable for arbitrary               n               {$\geq$}               m               {$\geq$} 0. This weaker assumption can be approximated in practice using cryptographic methods.},
