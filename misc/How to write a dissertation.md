Start writing in *Feb*
- Finish draft by the end of March
- Ask supervisor and dos to read
- Update and submit at the beh
- Finish all programming, testing and results by the end of lent term

___

Reader
- Two or three computer science lecturers or professors
- They may not know the detailed area of your project
- They will read your dissertation fairly quickly
- They typically only glance at your appendices
- They prefer good writing

Golden rule: Assume the reader has just finished 1b
- They read 40 dissertations in two weeks
- **clear and consise**
- Tell them what you want them to use
- Avoid code extracts

**Narrative arc**
- Ask a question or two at the outset
- Make sire the evaluation answers the qauestions
- Conclusion can restate the answer

- Research content is not required, the questions can be fairly simple.

- Method 1 and 2 is widely known, method 3 is new, i have a hunch that this will work better as  blah, 

**BLOCK DIAGRAM is worth 1000 words**
- circles for files, oblongs for processing, and how.
- UML class is likely 
- Discussion of implementation is easility explained with referenece to the diagram

**Bridging sentences**
- Get template
- Try to write the opening an closing sentence of each of the 5 chapters. These sentences can tell a story
- Knowing what your last sentence help focus all that comes before
- Recall interesting discussions you've have about your project and work out how these fit into the arc

- SUpervisor
- Director of Studies
- Friends

- DONT assume people will read a second draft
- You will need *two weeks* to produce the final version

## Structure
- Introduction
	- Short. What the problem and starting point. Cite existing solutions
	 - Clear first paragraph
		 - What your project is about and how well you've done it.
- Preparation
	- Mention tool, libraries, databases algorithms that you had to learn, master or otherwise collate
	 - Work done before code was code
	 - Success criteria elaboration maybe
	 - Evidence of good software practice 
	 - Explain background material beyond Part Ib
	  - Explain your own notation so that phi has a content
- Implementation
	- Refer to block diagram. History of changed decisions is the main aspect of interest
	 - Level of detail
		 - Tell the reader something about how you implemented this clever algorithm
		 - Demonstrate clear thinking, sensible decisions, knowledge, skill etc.
- Evaluation: throughly plan this. Often a weak aspect
	- Demonstrate scucess
	- Provide evidence that you met your success criteria
	- Be systematic - answer questions posed at the outset
	- Use appropriate techiques (e.g. confidence intervals)
	- Sensitivity analysis
	- Ensure comparisions with other work are fair
	- Try to go beyond a simple measure of performance or correness
	- Use appropriate visualisation
	 - Can still get high marks if you properly explain why.
- Conclusion: Short. 'Retrospectively I would..'
	- Reiterate in the first paragraph what your project was about
	- Say how well you've done it
	- Report on how yor evaluation answered any arc question
	- @
- Professional Practice and Presentation
	- Basics right - pleasent to read PDF, grammar, spell check
	- Appropriate tools, libraries, revision control , licensing, data protection, *unit testing*, development model, etc..
	- Demonstrate an ethical approach in your work.
 - Language tips
	 - Do not use contrations
	 - Write as much text in the third person
	 - Use "I" for parts of the narative where it is important for emphasiss
	 - we is OK for "the reader and I"
	 - Hyphenate compound adjectives: "light-blue ball", "high-level language" 
	 - Avoid doubt and convoluted sentences: "I planned to aim at the possibility of constructing.." Be definite; be judgemental
  

**Word budget**

- Preparation 2,500 words
- Implementation 4,500 words
